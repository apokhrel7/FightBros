*Fight Bros* is a two player fighting game made in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the previous version (Part 1) I implemented a basic overview and layout of the game without utilizing any functionality. In this assignment (Part Two), the functionality for the game has been fully implemented.

### Target Platform
This game is desgined for use in desktop.

### Game Genre
Strategy fighting, competition, action, multiplayer.

### Games Objective:
This game is to be played by two players on the same desktop device. These two players will fight each other until one of them wins by depleting the health of the other. There will be maximum 30 seconds for the two players to fight each other.

### Game Rules and Mechanics 
Both players begin with maximum health. For each hit on a player, their corresponding health decreases. A player is able to hit the other player by remaining on the ground (ground attack) or hit by jumping (air attack: results in more damage). There is a 30 second time limit. During that time limit either player can win by killing the other. If neither player is able to defeat the other and the time runs out, then winner is decided by the player who has more health. If both players have same health when timer runs out, the fight is declared as a "draw".
