# Project Reflection

## Workflow
The following was the sequence of my workflow for this project:

1. Implementing Basic Game Mechanics
   - Project Setup
   - Designing Healthbar and Timer
   - Creating and Designing Players
   - Move Players Using Keyboard Event Listeners
   - Implement Player Attacks and Other Game Mechanics
2. Implementing Animations and Interface
   - Player One and Player Two Animation
   - End of Game Interface


## What I Learned
- Planning ahead is essential 
  - You want to be on track on what you're supposed to be doing
  - This makes sure I implemented the most important features first rather than trying to create features that were not essential to the gameplay
  - I gave myself to fully plan out the scope of this project so I know most of what I needed to accomplish
  - Know what features are better off not implementing ("Having a few well-implemented, polished features is more important than many shallow ones. Focus on depth in the mechanics you choose to include.")
- Know how to use resources online
  - There were many things I wanted to do, but didn't know how
  - It was important to know how to search for things, such as creating animations

## Challenges
- I chose to make a two-player fighting game because I found these types of games fun and wanted to make my own. However, as it many programs, it seemed very basic and simple but as you go on the scope and complexity becomes greater than you imagined it to be.
- This occured to me when I was implementing the player movement. I noticed that I had to keep track of many things such as collision detection, player move state, animations, player damage and health, etc. Therefore, it was a challenge to design clean code that is easy to manage and maintain, but my initally planning greatly helped with that as I managed to keep my implementation fairly good quality.
- Another difficult challenge was to create animations for the players. I haven't done this before, so it took a lot of research and trial-and-error to see how I can add smooth animation to the game. I also had to switch sprites based on what the player was doing such as running, staying still, jumping, attacking, getting hit, and dying. There was a lot of things I had to keep track of, so it was essential to stay organized by keeping player and sprite information  in their own separate classes

## Final Product
- Initial design was very easy to do as I only had display the interface and design
- I was planning to use or make my own animation assets, but it turned out too time consuming to draw the necessary frames for a smooth animation. So I decided use CC0 assets from online
- As I had a fairly good plan, the final product interface looks similar to the initial design from Part One of the asssignment (healthbar, 2D game, timer, game objective, etc.)
- Some new things I added were:
  - Sound effects for player attacks and player getting hit
  - Instructions on how to play at bottom of page
  - End of game display and replay button
